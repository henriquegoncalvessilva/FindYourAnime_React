This project was an study about **React.Js**. 

In this project I used all thing what I learn in **my first month studing** #react. I loved the result, because I achieved use some important resources: 

 - Hooks
	 - UseState
	 - UseEffects
 - ContextAPI
- FetchAPI
	- API [Jinkan.moe](https://jikan.moe/)
- Functional Components
- Good practices
	- Separated components

Also i tried organize the project of the best possible. Note: the **focus this project was React** and don't HTML and CSS, so some elements can don't have style.
